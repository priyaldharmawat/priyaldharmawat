### 👋 Hi, I’m Priyal Dharmawat

I design data solutions that solve real business problems — not just models that sit in notebooks.
With 3+ years in analytics, machine learning, and business strategy, I bridge the gap between raw data and real impact.

Whether it’s forecasting demand, predictive modeling, or uncovering insights hidden in millions of rows —
I bring clarity, structure, and action to the table.


## 💼 Real-World Experience

- Built demand forecasting and KPI dashboards that reduced stockouts and staffing costs at North of Brooklyn
- Applied clustering and anomaly detection to optimize funding for 2,000+ nonprofits at Mass Culture
- Automated high-volume financial reporting and resolved $10M+ data issues at Capgemini


## 📊 What I Bring to the Table

- Languages & Tools: Python, R, SQL, Bash, Excel, Tableau, Power BI
- Tech & ML: NLP, Forecasting, Clustering, CNNs, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Kera, KNN
- Analytics Stack: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, SQL Server, Oracle
- Statistics: Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, ANOVA, PCA, Factor Analysis

## 🧐 About Me

I thrive at the intersection of data, strategy, and real-world impact.
From building ML models to crafting dashboards — I turn noise into narrative.

## 🏸 Beyond the Data
