## Hey there, I'm Priyal 👋

Super adaptive, curious about everything — especially data, AI, and the systems behind how things work.  
I thrive in fast-paced environments, and I learn like a sponge 🧠⚡  
I'm the person who will deep-dive into any new tech, tool, or method and **actually ship something with it**.
